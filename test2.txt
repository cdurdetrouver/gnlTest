I’m just a guy who’s a hero for fun.
The true power of us human beings is that we can change ourselves on our own.
The world is full of justice. But there is no true justice.
In exchange for power, you lose something dear.
I don’t think it’s a crime to kill a villain. But I also don’t think it’s a good thing to kill someone who’s innocent.
It’s not about overpowering an enemy. It’s about overpowering yourself.
Deep inside, you’re nothing more than a coward who can’t even bear to be alone.
The difference in skill is what makes the world go round.
You’re the strongest hero, but you also have the worst sense of direction.
Human beings are strong because we can change ourselves.
There are no heroes or villains. Just people who make decisions.
You think you can just turn your back on the world and live in peace? You’re pathetic!
I’ve never relied on anyone my whole life. It’s because I’m weak.
When you’re miserable, you need something that’s even more miserable than you to feel good about yourself.
Monsters are born too weak to be useful. But I don’t want to stay weak.
Being a hero means fighting back even when it seems hopeless.
I don’t want to regret not having done something when I had the chance.
Strength is justice. Strength is absolute.
There is no such thing as absolute evil or absolute good. Just people with good intentions or bad intentions.
The true power of an individual is to be able to master yourself.
You can’t use society as an excuse to avoid facing yourself.
If you really want to become strong, stop caring about what others think about you.
You’re right. Heroes are everywhere. There are a lot of people who want to help others.
No one knows what the future holds. That’s why its potential is infinite.
I’ll keep pushing myself until I become the strongest.
I just punch until it stops moving. That’s it.
To become strong, you must first accept your own weaknesses.
If the heroes run and hide, who will stay and fight?
Weaklings will stay weak forever. But weakness is not evil, since human beings are weak creatures to begin with.
The true power of a hero lies not in their strength, but in their ability to inspire others.
No matter how powerful you become, don’t become a monster in the process.
Sometimes you have to take a step back to see the bigger picture.
I’ve become too strong.
You’re really cool.
Laboring for the sake of others isn’t that bad of a thing.
I’m not saying I need fans, but it would be nice if someone noticed what I’ve been doing.
Instead of sitting around frustrated it’s better to keep on moving forward.
Is that really the limit of your strength? Could the you of tomorrow beat you today? Instead of giving in, move forward.
I will not grow if I cannot face superior opponents.
Human strength lies in the ability to change yourself.
I’ll leave tomorrow’s problem to tomorrow’s me.
If heroes run and hide who will stay and fight?
You are too young to worry about failure. In a pinch, just muddle through. The outcome won’t change, so that’s best
Instead of sitting here frustrated, it’s better to keep moving forward.
You are calm and intelligent, but youth can invite disaster. Do not fight alone.
You gotta train like hell until the point where your hair falls out. That’s the only way to become truly strong.
Overwhelming strength is boring.
100 Push-ups. 100 sit-ups. And 100 squats. Then a 10-kilometer run. Do it every single day!
A hero must be tough, strong, and beautiful… As well as able to promptly and splendidly eradicate evil.
If you really want to become strong, stop caring about what others think about you. Living your life has nothing to do with what others think.
